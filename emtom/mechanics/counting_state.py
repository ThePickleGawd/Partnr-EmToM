    Objects require multiple interactions to change state.

    Unlike CountingTriggerMechanic which only works on buttons, this
    mechanic works with ANY interactable object. At episode start,
    it discovers objects in the scene and randomly selects which
    require multiple interactions.

    Examples:
    - A cabinet might only open after being tried 3 times
    - A lamp might only turn on after being toggled 5 times
    - A drawer might only close after being pushed twice

    The agent must discover this hidden threshold through experimentation.

    This mechanic tests whether agents can:
    1. Detect that an action has no immediate effect
    2. Persist in trying the same action
    3. Discover the threshold through trial and error
    4. Remember and apply this knowledge
