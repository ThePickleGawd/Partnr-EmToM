Inverse State Mechanic.

Actions that change any binary state have the opposite effect.

    Actions that change binary states have inverse effects.

    Unlike InverseOpenMechanic which only works on doors, this mechanic
    works on ANY object with a binary state property.

    At episode start, it discovers objects in the scene and randomly
    selects which objects (and which states) to invert.

    Examples:
    - Trying to "open" a cabinet closes it instead
    - Trying to "turn_on" a lamp turns it off instead
    - Trying to "fill" a cup empties it instead

    This mechanic tests whether agents can:
    1. Detect the unexpected behavior
    2. Update their mental model
    3. Use the inverse action to achieve their goal
