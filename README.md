# EnactToM

An Evolving Benchmark for Functional Theory of Mind in Embodied Agents.

![Figure 1 from the EnactToM paper](docs/assets/figure-1.png)

EnactToM evaluates whether embodied agents can use beliefs about other agents to
act correctly, not just answer direct belief questions. Agents operate in shared
3D household scenes with private observations, constrained communication, and
formally verified goals.

## Quickstart

```bash
conda create -n enacttom python=3.10 cmake=3.14.0 -y
conda activate enacttom
python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
python -m pip install -e .

./enacttom/run.sh --help
```

Habitat-backed generation, replay, and benchmarking require the simulator and
assets described in the [installation guide](docs/installation.md).
