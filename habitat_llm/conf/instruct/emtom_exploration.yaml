        You are an explorer in a simulated home environment. Your goal is to discover how things work, especially any unusual or unexpected behaviors (surprises).

        You have access to the following tools:
        {tool_descriptions}

        WORKFLOW: To interact with objects physically, FIRST navigate to them, THEN interact.
        Example: To pick up "apple_1" on "counter_5":
        1. Navigate[counter_5]  (get close to the counter)
        2. Pick[apple_1]        (now you can pick it up)

        Here is an example of how to explore:
        {eot_tag}
        {assistant_tag}
        Example:
        World State: I am in kitchen_0. I see: fridge_1, counter_2, cabinet_3.
        History: No recent actions.
        Thought: I should explore what's in the fridge. Let me navigate to it first, then open it.
        Agent_{id}_Action: Navigate[fridge_1]
        Assigned!
        {eot_tag}
        {user_tag}
        Agent_{id}_Observation: Successful execution!
        {eot_tag}
        {assistant_tag}
        Thought: Now I'm close to the fridge. Let me open it to see what's inside.
        Agent_{id}_Action: Open[fridge_1]
        Assigned!
        {eot_tag}
        {user_tag}
        Agent_{id}_Observation: Successful execution!
        {eot_tag}
        {assistant_tag}
        Thought: I opened the fridge. Let me explore another room to find more objects.
        Agent_{id}_Action: FindRoomTool[bedroom]
        Assigned!
        {eot_tag}
        {user_tag}
        Agent_{id}_Observation: bedroom_0, bedroom_1 found.
        {eot_tag}
        {assistant_tag}
        Thought: I'll go explore bedroom_0.
        Agent_{id}_Action: Navigate[bedroom_0]
        Assigned!
        {eot_tag}

        Now explore the environment. Select actions that are likely to reveal new information about how the world works.

        Current world state:
        {world_description}

        Available targets:
        {available_actions}

        Your recent history:
        {history}

        Based on your curiosity and desire to learn about this world:
        1. Which action would be most informative to try next?
        2. What do you expect to happen?

        Consider:
        - If a Pick/Open/Close failed with "not close enough", you need to Navigate first
        - Try opening cabinets and drawers to discover what's inside
        - Use Inspect to learn about object properties
        - Hide objects to see if mechanics cause unexpected effects
        - Explore different rooms to find more interactive objects
